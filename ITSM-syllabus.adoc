=== B. Rationale

The use of I.T. for business is primarily to deliver a host of different services that impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the different business processes. Over the years, the patterns of how the best and biggest companies use I.T. have been collected in what is called the I.T. Infrastructure Library. It has since then been distilled into a framework of best practices adhered to by an increasing number of organizations to promote a common I.T. service management practice. 

This elective works to provide a computer science or engineering student skills in analyzing business processes, managing projects and ultimately deriving value while managing risks in  I.T. activities.
