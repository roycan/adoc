// Let's consider some common context 
// ECQ, ___ wants to buy headphones online for zoom classes AKA netflix ...
// If Sir Roy is the seller, what does Sir need to know about you i.e, what's in Sir's database about you?


== Customer Entity


[uml, file='customer.png']

@startuml

entity Customer {
  Customer_ID
  --
  Name
  Address
}
@enduml

Table:

> CUSTOMER(Customer_ID, Name, Address)


// If there's a Customer Entity in the context of ___ wanting to buy his headphones, what other Entity is important to be there? 


== Product Entity


[uml, file='product.png']
--
@startuml

entity Product {
  Product_num
  --
  Model
  Description
}
@enduml

Table:

> PRODUCT(Product_num, Model, Description)


// commend understanding
// as BA scholars, I recommend we go deeper a bit
// Customers create Orders, which contains a list of products with corresponding quantitiess
// so we need an Order entity
// an Order will have to be billed with an Invoice,
// so we need an Invoice entity
// the headphones have to be delivered
// so we need a Shipping Entity
// Now take paper, pen and 2 minutes to jot down what attributes you think are important for the Order, Invoice and Shipping Entities
// this is a good time for WheelofNames.com

// Why is there no lines from Shipping to Customer?
// Once you're clear with your concept, making the tables of your database is straightforward


== Tables 

> CUSTOMER(Custome_ID, Name, Address)

> PRODUCT(Product_num, Model, Description)

> INVOICE(Invoice_num, Order_num)

> SHIPPING(Shipping_num, Product, Quantity) 


// Ofcouse while doing the database, you'll probably think of all sorts of important details to include

// This slide can be improved.

== Takeaways

1. Get a Clear Concept
2. Streamline to Optimize
3. Connect Tables with foreign ID's

Databases are not magic, but they can look like it when well designed.  :)
